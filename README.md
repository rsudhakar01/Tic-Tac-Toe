# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Description 
This is a simple tic tac toe game where the player plays against the computer. The program makes use of random positions rather than playing 'smartly', and it is extremely likely that the player will win. A bot which makes its next move based on what the player has played is currently being implemented.

# Instructions 
Enter the position where you want to play. The positions are numbered 1-9 with 1,2,3 corresponding to the top of the board and so on.
